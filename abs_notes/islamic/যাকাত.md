**There are two ways to calculate zakah:**
1. **Trace each day or week or month:** Calculate your nesab everyday and keep trace of it. You can consider week or month instead. But it's very difficult to do so and isn't practical at all.
2. **Pick a particular day in a whole year:** Consider a particular day and calculate your zakah exactly one year after. It's easy and hope you won't miss anything. Most of the people prefer ramadan because it is the month of the charity.
* Nisab should be calculated according to the `Hizri` calendar not the Solar calendar. That means- 1st of January or 1st of December is wrong, 1st of Shaban or 1st of Hajj would be right. And you can consider any day, like- 20th of Ramadan.
* Suppose, you take 1st of Ramadan 1445 Hijri - Calculate all the assets that you have (your nesab) in 1st of Ramadan 1446 Hijri.
* Even if it is the lowest amount (your nesab) of the whole year, you are giving the minimum amount of your Zakah. So it is safe. And it might be the highest amount of the whole year.

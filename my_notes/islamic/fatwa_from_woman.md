## **Is it permissible to take fatwa from a Muslim Female Scholar?**
In Islam, it is permissible for a Muslim woman to issue a fatwa (Islamic ruling) if she meets the necessary qualifications. There is no restriction in the Quran or Hadith that prohibits women from giving fatwas. In fact, historical evidence shows that many female scholars were respected for their knowledge and issued fatwas.

### **Quranic and Hadith Justifications:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;• The **Quran** encourages seeking knowledge for both men and women:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**"Say, Are those who know equal to those who do not know?"** *`(Surah Az-Zumar 39:9)`*

&nbsp;&nbsp;• The **Prophet Muhammad** (peace be upon him) said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**"Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim."** *`(Sunan Ibn Majah 224)`*

&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Aisha(RA)**, the wife of the Prophet, was one of the most knowledgeable scholars and issued fatwas that even senior male companions followed.

### **Views of Islamic Scholars:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Imam An-Nawawi** stated that a mufti (fatwa giver) must be knowledgeable, trustworthy, and capable of understanding Islamic rulings—gender is not a condition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Ibn Abd al-Barr** mentioned that Aisha (RA) was frequently consulted for fatwas, even by senior male companions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Umm Darda(RA)** was another female scholar known for issuing fatwas and teaching men.
### **Women Scholars in Islamic History:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Aisha bint Abu Bakr(RA)** — Narrated over 2,000 hadiths and issued fatwas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Fatima bint Qasim** — A respected scholar in Andalus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Amrah bint Abdul Rahman** — A student of Aisha (RA) and a renowned jurist.

### **Final Thought:**
Islam does not prohibit women from issuing fatwas. The key requirement is knowledge, understanding, and adherence to Islamic principles. Many female scholars throughout history have played a vital role in Islamic jurisprudence.

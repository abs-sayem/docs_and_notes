In a 10-band equalizer, each vertical bar represents a specific frequency range of sound. Adjusting these bars allows you to boost or reduce certain frequencies, shaping the overall sound profile.

**Understanding the 10 Bands:**
1. **`31 Hz`**: Represents the deep bass. Boosting this enhances the rumble and sub-bass frequencies, often felt rather than heard.
2. **`62 Hz`**: Covers the low bass. Boosting this adds punch to bass instruments like drums and bass guitars.
3. **`125 Hz`**: Represents the mid-bass. Boosting this gives warmth to the bass but too much can make the sound muddy.
4. **`250 Hz`**: Covers the low mids. Boosting this adds body to the sound, but excessive boosting can make it boxy.
5. **`500 Hz`**: Represents the midrange. Boosting this enhances clarity in vocals and instruments, but itâ€™s not ideal for bass-heavy sound.
6. **`1 kHz`**: Covers the upper mids. Boosting this improves vocal presence and instrument attack.
7. **`2 kHz`**: Represents the high mids. Boosting this adds sharpness and definition to instruments.
8. **`4 kHz`**: Covers the presence range. Boosting this makes the sound more detailed and crisp.
9. **`8 kHz`**: Represents the treble. Boosting this adds brightness and sparkle to the sound.
10. **`16 kHz`**: Covers the air frequencies. Boosting this adds a sense of openness and sheen.

**Balanced Equalizer Settings:**
1. **`31 Hz`**: +10 to +20 (slight boost for deep bass presence).
2. **`62 Hz`**: +10 to +15 (subtle low bass enhancement without overpowering).
3. **`125 Hz`**: 0 to +10 (keep mid-bass neutral or slightly enhanced for warmth).
4. **`250 Hz`**: 0 (neutral to avoid boxy sound).
5. **`500 Hz`**: -10 to 0 (slight reduction or neutrality for midrange clarity).
6. **`1 kHz`**: 0 (neutral for balanced vocals and instruments).
7. **`2 kHz`**: +5 to +10 (add definition to instruments and vocals)
8. **`4 kHz`**: +10 (enhance presence and crispness without over-sharpening).
9. **`8 kHz`**: +5 to +15 (brighten treble for detail and sparkle).
10. **`16 kHz`**: +5 to +10 (add subtle airiness for openness).

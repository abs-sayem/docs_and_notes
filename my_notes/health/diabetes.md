# 🩺 **Diabetes: Quick Guide**

## 📌 **What is Diabetes?**

**Diabetes** is a **chronic disease** that affects how your body turns food into energy.

When you eat, most food is broken down into sugar (**glucose**) and released into your bloodstream. When blood sugar goes up, it signals your **pancreas** to release **insulin**.

🔑 **Insulin** acts like a key — it lets blood sugar enter your body’s cells to be used as energy.

**If you have diabetes**, your body either:
- Doesn’t make enough insulin, **or**
- Can’t use the insulin it makes effectively.

When this happens, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream, which over time can lead to **heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease**.

## 🏥 **What is a Chronic Disease?**

A **chronic disease** is a condition that:
- Lasts for an extended period of time.
- Requires ongoing medical care.

**Examples:** heart disease, cancer, diabetes

## 🔬 **Pancreas: The Insulin Factory**

Your **pancreas** is an organ behind your abdomen. It’s part of your digestive system **and** acts as a gland.

- **Exocrine function:** Makes digestive enzymes.
- **Endocrine function:** Produces hormones like insulin to control blood sugar.

## ⚖️ **What Happens If Blood Sugar Stays High?**

Chronically high blood sugar can damage:
- **Heart**
- **Eyes (vision loss)**
- **Kidneys**

## ✅ **Safe Blood Sugar Levels**

| State | Safe Range |
|-------|----------------|
| Before Meals | **70–130 mg/dL** |
| After Meals | **Less than 180 mg/dL** |

## ⚠️ **Dangerous Blood Sugar Levels**

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|----------------|
| **Below 70 mg/dL** | Too low — **hypoglycemia**, can be dangerous. |
| **Above 180 mg/dL** | Too high — **hyperglycemia**, harmful if persistent. |

## 🔍 **Types of Diabetes**

There are **three main types**:  
👉 [More Details](https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/types-of-diabetes)

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Type 1** | An **autoimmune** condition — your immune system destroys insulin-producing **beta cells** in the pancreas. Damage is permanent. Cause: mostly genetic & environmental. Not linked to lifestyle. |
| **Type 2** | Starts as **insulin resistance** — your body can’t use insulin efficiently. Pancreas tries to compensate but eventually can’t keep up. Contributing factors: **genetics**, **sedentary lifestyle**, **overweight/obesity**. |
| **Gestational** | Occurs **during pregnancy**. Caused by insulin-blocking hormones made by the placenta. Risk is higher if you have **prediabetes** or family history. |

---

### 🏃 **Sedentary Lifestyle**
A **sedentary lifestyle** means **low physical activity**: sitting for long periods, excessive screen time, minimal exercise.

---

### ⚡ **Prediabetes**
- Blood sugar higher than normal, but **not** high enough to be diabetes.
- Without lifestyle changes, prediabetes can develop into **type 2 diabetes** within ~10 years.

## 🧪 **How to Test — Using a Glucometer**

| State | Normal | Abnormal |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Before meal (fasting)** | `< 6.1 mmol/L` | `≥ 7 mmol/L` |
| **After 2 hours (glucose drink)** | `< 7.8 mmol/L` | `≥ 11.1 mmol/L` |
| **Impaired Fasting Glucose** | `6.1 – 7.0 mmol/L` | — |
| **Impaired Glucose Tolerance** | `7.8 – 11.1 mmol/L` | — |

---

> ✅ **Tip:** Regular testing, healthy eating, and staying active are key to managing blood sugar!
